Welcome to **cub3D**, a project inspired by the legendary game **Wolfenstein 3D**! This project is your opportunity to create a 3D graphical representation of a maze using **Ray-Casting** principles, implemented in C with the **MiniLibX** library. Dive into the world of game development and relive the history of first-person shooters.

## Introduction

**Wolfenstein 3D**, developed by **John Carmack** and **John Romero** in 1992, is considered the first true "First-Person Shooter" (FPS) in the history of video games. It paved the way for iconic games like **Doom**, **Quake**, and **Duke Nukem 3D**.

In this project, **cub3D**, you will recreate a simplified version of this classic game using **Ray-Casting** techniques. To achieve this, we utilize **Bresenham's Algorithm** for efficient line drawing and rendering. The goal is to render a 3D maze from a first-person perspective, complete with textures, colors, and smooth controls.

## Bresenham's Algorithm ðŸŒŸ

**Bresenham's Algorithm** is an efficient method for line rasterization, i.e., drawing straight lines on a pixel grid. Developed by **Jack Elton Bresenham** in 1962, it is widely used in computer graphics due to its simplicity and efficiency, using only integer calculations and avoiding floating-point operations.

### How It Works

The algorithm determines which pixels should be colored to form a line between two points \((x_0, y_0)\) and \((x_1, y_1)\). It works incrementally, calculating a decision parameter to choose the next pixel to be drawn.

### Advantages

- **Efficiency**: Uses only integer operations.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement.
- **Speed**: Ideal for hardware with limited resources.

### Applications

- Drawing lines on computer screens.
- Rendering in game graphics engines.
- Path tracing in CNC machines.
- Edge detection in image processing.

### Example Usage

To draw a line from point \((1, 1)\) to \((4, 3)\), the algorithm selects the pixels \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 2)\), and \((4, 3)\).

## Goals of the project

- **Rigor**: Write clean, efficient, and well-structured code in C.
- **Mathematics**: Use mathematical concepts like vectors and trigonometry to implement Ray-Casting.
- **Graphics**: Learn to work with the **MiniLibX** library to manage windows, colors, and events.
- **Problem Solving**: Parse and validate map files, handle errors gracefully, and optimize performance.

---

## Features

- **3D Rendering**: Use Ray-Casting to render a 3D maze from a first-person perspective.
- **Textures**: Apply different wall textures based on their orientation (North, South, East, West).
- **Colors**: Set custom floor and ceiling colors.
- **Smooth Controls**:
  - Move forward, backward, left, and right using the **W**, **A**, **S**, and **D** keys.
  - Rotate the camera using the **left** and **right** arrow keys.
- **Window Management**:
  - Close the window using the **ESC** key or the window's close button.
  - Handle window resizing and minimizing gracefully.
- **Map Parsing**:
  - Parse `.cub` files to configure the maze and textures.
  - Validate map files to ensure they are closed and correctly formatted.

```

## Map Configuration

The `.cub` file must contain the following elements in any order (except the map, which must be last):

### Textures

- `NO ./path_to_the_north_texture`
- `SO ./path_to_the_south_texture`
- `WE ./path_to_the_west_texture`
- `EA ./path_to_the_east_texture`

### Colors

- `F R,G,B` (Floor color, e.g., `F 220,100,0`)
- `C R,G,B` (Ceiling color, e.g., `C 225,30,0`)

### Map

- Composed of `0` (empty space), `1` (wall), and `N`, `S`, `E`, or `W` (player's starting position and orientation).
- The map must be closed/surrounded by walls.

### Controls

- Movement: W, A, S, D.
- Rotation: Left Arrow, Right Arrow.
- Exit: ESC or close the window.
